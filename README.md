# Mk-Fixture-Generator

Generates match/league fixtures for teams created with Sportspress in WP. No need to rely on external websites that offer fixture generating. You can use it to generate fixtures for various scenarios and share with even having to base on WP. Just install Sportspress and this plugin, create teams, generate fixtures and export for your desired use wherever.
> It works out of the box once installed.

#### You can ```select Teams manually```, or through filters based on ```League/Season```.
#### It keeps your default league mode (Competitive, Friendly or Tournament)
#### Keeps your default venue (make sure to create one first)
#### Date and time selection. This helps with event scheduling and countdowns.
