# Mk-Fixture-Generator

Generates match/league fixtures for teams created with Sportspress in WP
> It works out of the box once installed.

#### You can ```select Teams manually```, or through filters based on ```League/Season```.
#### It keeps your default league mode (Competitive, Friendly or Tournament)
#### Keeps your default venue (make sure to create one first)
#### Date and time selection. This helps with event scheduling and countdowns.
